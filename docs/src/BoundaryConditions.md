# Creating boundary conditions

A boundary condition can be created for input to the solver


For Neumann and Dirichlet boundaries,
```@docs
SBP_operators.Helpers.Boundary
```
and for Periodic boundary conditions,
```@docs
SBP_operators.Helpers.PeriodicBoundary
```


Both are of type
```@docs
SBP_operators.Helpers.BoundaryConditionData
```
